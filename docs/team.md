Weâ€™re looking for **pathfinder project ideas** that could use the data to inform **transport planning** and measure **social inclusion** across the city, or would otherwise be of public benefit.

If you have a project idea, or to otherwise contact the team, email: [urbanride-project@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:urbanride-project@bristol.ac.uk)
