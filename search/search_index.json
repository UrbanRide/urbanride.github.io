This project aims to forge collaborations between the University of Bristol, UWE, micromobility operators and local government. Through these collaborations, we hope to use micromobility data to generate a huge number of timely, data driven policy outputs.

This data is routinely collected by GPS sensors on e-scooters and e-bikes across the region. It includes information on actual routes travelled, speed, date and time, and rider demographics. We\u2019re working to make the full dataset available for researchers at University of Bristol and UWE. We hope that the data will be used to inform wider transport planning and measure social inclusion. We\u2019re looking for pathfinder project ideas that could use the data to inform transport planning and measure social inclusion across the city, or would otherwise be of public benefit. Example research topics Possible research topics include: Safety and comfort\u200b Safety Comfort Transport policy Access and usage\u200b Modal shift\u200b Employment and economy\u200b Transport integration\u200b Network performance\u200b Management and operational Parking & highways\u200b Redeployment\u200b Communication & education\u200b Commercial models\u200b Wider impacts Health & wellbeing\u200b Carbon emissions\u200b How the data will be shared There will be processes to protect unauthorised use of data, and the data will be hosted in a Trusted Research Environment (TRE)\u200b.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-the-project","text":"The project aims to enable the sharing of micromobility data for research and policy support.
